# Final Year Project

To run the website you would need to follow the steps mentioned below:

Step 1: Download xampp from the link attached https://www.apachefriends.org/
Step 2: Navigate to the download location of xampp and unzip the code files into C:/xampp/htdocs/
Step 3: Launch xampp application (should be named xampp control panel) and start both apache and MySQL, run MySQL as admin as well (this will take you to a browser)
Step 4: On the top few options go ahead and click database (name it whatever you like) and create a new database.
Step 5: Once you have created a new database, click the import button on top and choose file. (I have created the database called shop_db)
Step 6: Navigate to the C:xampp/htdocs/PROJECT/shop_db.sql
Step 7: Once you have done that, you should be good to go!
Step 8: Go ahead into your browser and type in localhost/PROJECT/home.php
